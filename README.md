# A simple enviroment for PHP TDD 

A simple skeleton project to test PHP with PHPUnit.

## To use

* Download/Clone the repository
* Open root folder in the terminal/command prompt

I have included a simple math test just to show its working.
This is what I use for my PHP TDD.

## Create your own tests. 

You create the PHPUnit test in the tests directory and the clss for the functions in src folder.

## Run tests

 * php vendor/bin/phpunit tests --color

## Requirements

* PHP 8
* Composer
